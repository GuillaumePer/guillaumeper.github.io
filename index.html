				<h2 id="Su2">Facial Recognition & Compressed Sensing</h2>
					<p>
					For most Humans, there is no major issue when it comes to recognize people or objects that surround us in our daily
					life : this ability is deeply embedded in our nature and habits. We have been identifying, classifying/labelling and memorizing objects 
					since our childhood. Hence this process has become almost instinctive to us.</p>
					<p>But what happens when it comes to computers or machines ? They do not have the same background and the same
					resources as we do. Neither have they time to go through the same learning process as we did.</p>
					<p>
					Nevertheless, face and object recognition is a central issue for industry and our societies nowadays.
					Hence Computer Face and Object Recognition has become of the highest interest for many tangible applications in recent years.
					</p>
					<p>
					Many techniques from improved general PCA to more elaborated and recent attempts like Deep Learning have been
					decicated to reach that goal, some of the hereafore mentioned methods more difficult to implement than others or more sensitive to
					loss of data and occlusion.
					</p>
					<p>
					An approach based on Compressed Sensing, proposed n <a href=""><em>""</em></a>, has thus been implemented and confirmed the feasibility 
					of such a method which takes advantage of the sparsity of the retrieved solutions. Sparsity of Representation for Classification - SRC- 
					is designed in such a way that it is robust to real life conditions such as variations in lighting, change in facial expressions, and 
					face occlusion and data corruption.
					</p>
					<p>
					Tests were run using 2 face databases:
						<ol>
							<li>Yale B Database ("CroppedYale") - a collection of 39 categories with up to 64 variations in lighting;</li>
							<li>Yalefaces Database - a collection of 15 categories with 11 variations (lighting, facial expressions, adds-on (glasses)). </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
					The success of the method has also been proven for object recognition for object databases such as the one created by the 
					<a href=""><em>ALOI</em></a> and available at <a href=""><em>following this link</em></a>
				<h2 id="Su3">Network analysis for Marketing Purposes</h2>
					<p>
					Nowadays social media such as Twitter have become a reality not only in the news media but also in 
					the marketing business. Lots of companies use those means to promote events, their products and their 
					services. They nurture their branding and reputation using their social media accounts as a prevailing platform
					of communication.
					</p>
					<p>
					But sometimes, those can be turnt around and serve as a public floor for customers facing operating 
					issues with some companies to express their disagreement and sometimes huge disappointment.
					This project's goal was thus to study the spread of this kind of information throughout twitter's network, 
					to understand how it becomes viral news	and how this could affect a company's image and even its internal policies.
